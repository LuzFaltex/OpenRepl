# OpenRepl
An open-source REPL service with Docker support. Designed to be used with the [MODiX](https://github.com/discord-csharp/MODiX) Discord bot's code eval feature.

>This application is not yet ready for production, nor is it a stable alpha build. I will announce here when it reaches various stages of production.
>
>Also, while pull requests are appreciated, pull requests to add language support are not being taken at this time. The API is very likely to undergo several large changes before I consider it to be a stable alpha.
